To prepare to run litmus-test translation scripts:

	cd RCUxlate
	make

This will create the stripocamlcomment binary required by the scripts.

Contents of this archive:

./	Prototype LWN paper and teleconference notes.

./DIYLinuxMM/

	Implementation of a fragment of the Linux-kernel API in userspace.
	This can be used in DIY testing of Linux-kernel litmus tests.

./LinuxModel/

	Expanded tarball of Linux-kerenl litmus tests from Jade.

./models/

	Random models, .bell and .cat files.

./RCUmodel/

	Script-based models of RCU for LISA models.  These can be thought
	of as RCU implementations written in LISA.  They are quite slow,
	but are reasonably accurate.

	Note: None are yet perfect, and probably won't be due to the
	fact that they don't model compiler optimizations.  Modeling
	compiler optimizations requires considerable code reordering,
	which would add yet another round of combinatorial explosion.
	One possibility would be to create multiple simpler litmus tests
	and combine the results of all of them.

./RCUxlate/

	Scripts for converting litmus tests containing f[rcu_read_lock],
	f[rcu_read_unlock], and f[sync] into equivalent models based on
	loads, stores, and memory barriers.
