 * Result: Sometimes
 * 
 * Process 0 starts (t=297997).
 * 
 * P0 advances slightly (t=297998).
 * 
 * P1 -maybe- goes back a bit less than one grace period (t=198999).
 * 
 * P2 -maybe- goes back a bit less than one grace period (t=100000).
 * 
 * Process 0 start at t=297997, process 3 end at t=100000: Cycle allowed.
