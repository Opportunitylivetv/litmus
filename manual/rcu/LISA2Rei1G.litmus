(*
 * Result: Sometimes
 *
 * One RCU grace period and two RCU read-side critical sections.
 * This would normally allow the cycle, but the first RCU read-side
 * critical section contains a memory barrier.  Unfortunately, this
 * memory barrier does not force all of the first critical section
 * to precede the grace period.  Cycle allowed.
