(*
 * Result: Never
 *
 * A single RCU grace period with two RCU read-side critical sections,
 * however, with a release-acquire relationship between the first
 * critical section and the beginning of the grace period.  This
 * release-acquire relationship forces the first critical section to
 * entirely precede the grace period, so that there can be no overlap
 * with P2's RCU read-side critical section.  Cycle prohibited.
