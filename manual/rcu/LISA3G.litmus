(*
 * Result: Always
 *
 * Three RCU grace periods with absolutely nothing else.  There is no
 * cycle to be either prohibited or allowed.  This litmus test is therefore
 * not particularly interesting except as a test case for the script that
 * converts litmus tests to auxiliary-variable form.  "Cycle" prohibited.
