(*
 * One grace period and three RCU read-side critical sections.
 * Ordering across a RCU grace period could prohibit cycles, except that
 * P3's RCU read-side critical section still allows the needed misordering.
 * The reason that this ordering is not completely redundant with the grace
 * period is that it forces P0's critical section to precede that of P2.
 * Cycle allowed.
