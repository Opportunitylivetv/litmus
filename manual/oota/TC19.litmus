LISA TC19
(*
 * Result: Never
 *
 * http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/unifiedProposal/testcases.html
 *
 * Decision: Allowed.  This is the same as test case 17, except that
 *	thread 1 has been split into two threads.
 *
 * Note: Maybe for Java, but relaxed atomics in C11 prohibit violating
 *	cache coherence.  Adjusted result accordingly.
