LISA TC5
(*
 * Result: Never
 *
 * http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/unifiedProposal/testcases.html
 *
 * Decision: Forbidden: values are not allowed to come out of thin air,
 *	even if there are other executions in which the thin-air value
 *	would have been written to that variable by some not out-of-thin
 *	air means.
 *
 * Note: herd7 claims Never, but lists "0:r1=S4; 1:r2=S4; 3:r3=1;"
 *	Help?
